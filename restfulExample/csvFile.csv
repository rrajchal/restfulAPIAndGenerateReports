The goal of Amesos is to make AX=S as easy as it sounds, at least for direct methods. Amesos provides interfaces to a number of third party sparse direct solvers, including SuperLU, SuperLU MPI, DSCPACK, UMFPACK and KLU. Amesos provides a common object oriented interface to the best sparse direct solvers in the world. A sparse direct solver solves for x in Ax = b. where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors (or multi-vectors). A sparse direct solver flrst factors A into trinagular matrices L and U such that A = LU via gaussian elimination and then solves LU x = b. Switching amongst solvers in Amesos roquires a change to a single parameter. Yet, no solver needs to be linked it, unless it is used. All conversions between the matrices provided by the user and the format required by the underlying solver is performed by Amesos. As new sparse direct solvers are created, they will be incorporated into Amesos, allowing the user to simpty link with the new solver, change a single parameter in the calling sequence, and use the new solver. Amesos allows users to specify whether the matrix has changed. Amesos can be used anywhere that any sparse direct solver is needed.",8344830.4,https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos,Production,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

The first application of this model has been for modeling the performance of thermal batteries. However, an implementation for secondary ion batteries is next. CanTrilBat applications solves transient problems involving batteries. It is a 1-D application that represents 3-D physical systems that can be reduced using the porous flow approximation for the anode, cathode, and separator. A control volume formulation is used to track conserved quantities. An operator-split approach is used to calculate the chemistry, diffusion and electronic transport that occurs within cathode and anode particles, allowing for the reduction in code complexity.",97432.0,https://github.com/Cantera/cantera,Production,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

UPC++ includes two main features beyond UPC: 1) One of the major limitations of UPC in the context of DOE application is the relatively weak notion of multidimensional arrays, which it inherited from C. To remedy this problem in UPC++, we included a multidimensional domain and array library based on that of Titanium. Titanium's library is similar to Chapel's dense and strided domains, as both were inspired by the dense and strided regions and arrays in ZPL. 2) Another feature provided by UPC++ but not by UPC is remote function invocation, which is inspired by Phalanx, X10, Habanero-C, and C++11. The user may start an asynchronous remote function invocation with the following syntax: async(place)(function, args...);. UPC++ provides two programming constructs for specifying dynamic dependencies among tasks: 1) event-driven execution as in Phalanx and Habanero-C; 2) finish-async as in X10. We implemented UPC++ with a compiler-free approach using C++ templates and runtime libraries. The UPC++ front-end consists of a set of C++ header files that enables the C++ compiler to translate UPC++ features in a user program to runtime library calls.

It is very much a current work in progress, and much of the intended functionality is still under development. The main goal of brulilo is an easy-to-use code for quick calculations or post-processing, as well as a learning tool to test various implementations of solvers on both CPUs and GPUs. Currently, brulilo parses an input text file that specifies the reactions to be included in the network. The notation of the inputs are in the typical astrophysical notation; i.e. hydrogen burning to deuterium in the sun, p + p + e --> d + neutrino, is given as p(p,)d. Each reaction is added to a list comprising the reaction network, and once completed, the network contains a list of all isotopes and reactions involved. brulilo then parses publicly available nuclear data (binding energy, spin, partition function data, etc.) for each isotope from the WebNucleo group's data at nucleo.ces.clemson.edu. Fits to reaction rate data for each reaction are obtained from the publicly available data provided by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics' Reaclib database. Reverse reactions are calculated from detailed balance. The reaction network then consists of a sparse system of mathematically stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Physically, stiffness here means that there are some reaction rates that are occurring much faster than others; the ratio of the fast to slow often being greater than 10^15 in astrophysics. Numerical integration of such systems typically involves implicit integration schemes, which brulilo will leverage from the scientific computing Python package, Numpy, as well as implement its own. There has recently been work from researchers at Oak Ridge National Lab who have found good results from applying quasi-equilibrium and quasi-asymptotic conditions to the stiff system of ODEs, which effectively remove some of the stiffness and allow for efficient explicit integration techniques to be used. The original intent of brulilo was to implement these stiffness-alleviating techniques with explicit integrators and compare the performance to traditional implicit integrations of the full stiff system. This is still underway, as the code is very much in an alpha-release state. Furthermore, explicit integrators are often much easier to parallelize than their implicit counterparts. brulilo will implement parallelization of these techniques, leveraging both the Python implementation of MPI, mpi4py, as well as highly parallelized versions targeted at GPUs with PyOpenCL and/or PyCUDA.",1743379.2,https://github.com/cmsquared/brulilo,Production,"[DOE CODE,Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)]"

All jacobian operations in CanTrilBat utilize numerical jacobians. A home grown predictor corrector scheme is used for time step control, and a home grown newton solver is used to relax the equations at each time step. Trilinos is used to solve for the resulting linear systems equation A block text input format is used to initialize options for the CanTriBat program. Within this block are the names of several XML input files, which specify the chemistry mechanism. These XML input files are read by low level Cantera routines, and serve to initialize the electrode and electrolyte chemistry mechanisms and transport properties. A GUI implementation has been contracted out to a university professor, but has not been implemented yet. It?s expected that CanTriBat will have the capability to do adaptive grid refinement in later versions. Grids will be halved based on an complicated set of heuristic criteria, based on how well the mesh captures changes to the first and second derivatives of selected solution components.

The first code, Automated RSM, automates the generation of a drag coefficient RSM for a particular object to a single command. Automated RSM first creates a Latin Hypercube Sample (LHS) of 1,000 ensemble members to explore the global parameter space. For each ensemble member, a TPMC simulation is performed and the object drag coefficient is computed. In the next step of the Automated RSM code, a Gaussian process is used to fit the TPMC simulations. In the final step, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to evaluate the non-analytic probability distribution function from the Gaussian process. The second code, RSM Area, creates a look-up table for the projected area of the object based on input limits on the minimum and maximum allowed pitch and yaw angles and pitch and yaw angle intervals. The projected area from the look-up table is used to compute the ballistic coefficient of the object based on its pitch and yaw angle. An accurate ballistic coefficient is crucial in accurately computing the drag on an object. The third code, RSM Cd, uses the RSM generated by the Automated RSM code and the projected area look-up table generated by the RSM Area code to accurately compute the drag coefficient and ballistic coefficient of the object. The user can modify the object velocity, object surface temperature, the translational temperature of the gas, the species concentrations of the gas, and the pitch and yaw angles of the object.

The compiler is implemented by recognizing specific (syntactic) Kokkos constructs in order to bypass normal template expansion mechanisms and instead use the semantic knowledge of Kokkos to directly generate code in the compiler?s intermediate representation (IR); which is then translated into an NVIDIA-centric GPU program and supporting runtime calls.

Chem., 22, 1154 (2001)] and electrostatic interactions arising from atom-centered, fixed, point partial charges. The primary uses of the MC3 code are the computation of i) the temperature and pressure dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, ii) tensors of elastic constants and compliances via the Parrinello and Rahman?s fluctuation formula [M. Parrinello and A. Rahman, J. Chem. Phys., 76, 2662 (1982)], and iii) the investigation of polymorphic phase transformations. The MC3 code is written in Fortran90 and requires LAPACK and BLAS linear algebra libraries to be linked during compilation.

An important area of active research in pure mathematics is determining which graphs are determined by their spectra, i.e. when the spectrum of the adjacency matrix uniquely determines the underlying graph. We are interested in exploring the spectra of graphs in the Johnson scheme and specifically seek to determine which of these graphs are determined by their spectra. Given a graph G, a Godsil-McKay switching set is an induced subgraph H on 2k vertices with the following properties: I) H is regular, ii) every vertex in G/H is adjacent to either 0, k, or 2k vertices of H, and iii) at least one vertex in G/H is adjacent to k vertices in H. The software package examines each subset of a user specified size to determine whether or not it satisfies those 3 conditions. The software makes use of the massive parallel processing power of CUDA enabled GPUs. It also exploits the vertex transitivity of graphs in the Johnson scheme by reasoning that if G has a Godsil-McKay switching set, then it has a switching set which includes vertex 1. While the code (in its current state) is tuned to this specific problem, the method of examining each induced subgraph of G can be easily re-written to check for any user specified conditions on the subgraphs and can therefore be used much more broadly.",106.4,https://github.com/jtjohnston/computational_combinatorics,Production,"[DOE CODE,Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]"

Workflows become much more complex because they must seamlessly integrate simulation and data analytics. They must include down-sampling, post-processing, feature extraction, and visualization. Power and data transfer limitations require these analysis tasks to be run in-situ or in-transit. We expect successful workflows will comprise multiple linked simulations along with tens of analysis routines. Users will have limited development time at scale and, therefore, must have rich tools to develop, debug, test, and deploy applications. At this scale, successful workflows will compose linked computations from an assortment of reliable, well-defined computation elements, ones that can come and go as required, based on the needs of the workflow over time. We propose a novel framework that utilizes both virtual machines (VMs) and software containers to create a workflow system that establishes a uniform build and execution environment (BEE) beyond the capabilities of current systems. In this environment, applications will run reliably and repeatably across heterogeneous hardware and software. Containers, both commercial (Docker and Rocket) and open-source (LXC and LXD), define a runtime that isolates all software dependencies from the machine operating system. Workflows may contain multiple containers that run different operating systems, different software, and even different versions of the same software. We will run containers in open-source virtual machines (KVM) and emulators (QEMU) so that workflows run on any machine entirely in user-space. On this platform of containers and virtual machines, we will deliver workflow software that provides services, including repeatable execution, provenance, checkpointing, and future proofing. We will capture provenance about how containers were launched and how they interact to annotate workflows for repeatable and partial re-execution. We will coordinate the physical snapshots of virtual machines with parallel programming constructs, such as barriers, to automate checkpoint and restart. We will also integrate with HPC-specific container runtimes to gain access to accelerators and other specialized hardware to preserve native performance. Containers will link development to continuous integration.

BEMOSS is an open source operating system that is built upon VOLTTRON ? a distributed agent platform developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). BEMOSS was designed to make it easy for hardware manufacturers to seamlessly interface their devices with BEMOSS. Software developers can also contribute to adding additional BEMOSS functionalities and applications. (2) Plug & play ? BEMOSS was designed to automatically discover supported load controllers (including smart thermostats, VAV/RTUs, lighting load controllers and plug load controllers) in commercial buildings. (3) Interoperability ? BEMOSS was designed to work with load control devices form different manufacturers that operate on different communication technologies and data exchange protocols. (4) Cost effectiveness ? Implementation of BEMOSS deemed to be cost-effective as it was built upon a robust open source platform that can operate on a low-cost single-board computer, such as Odroid. This feature could contribute to its rapid deployment in small- or medium-sized commercial buildings. (5) Scalability and ease of deployment ? With its multi-node architecture, BEMOSS provides a distributed architecture where load controllers in a multi-floor and high occupancy building could be monitored and controlled by multiple single-board computers hosting BEMOSS. This makes it possible for a building engineer to deploy BEMOSS in one zone of a building, be comfortable with its operation, and later on expand the deployment to the entire building to make it more energy efficient. (6) Ability to provide local and remote monitoring ? BEMOSS provides both local and remote monitoring ability with role-based access control. (7) Security ? In addition to built-in security features provided by VOLTTRON, BEMOSS provides enhanced security features, including BEMOSS discovery approval process, encrypted core-to-node communication, thermostat anti-tampering feature and many more. (8) Support from the Advisory Committee ? BEMOSS was developed in consultation with an advisory committee from the beginning of the project.

In tomographic inversions studies, a seismologist begins with number of source-receiver travel time observations and an initial starting model of the velocity distribution within the Earth. A forward travel time calculator, such as the RSTT library, is used to compute predictions of each observed travel time and all of the residuals (observed minus predicted travel time) are calculated. The Earth model is then modified in some systematic way with the goal of minimizing the residuals. The Earth model obtained in this way is assumed to be a better model than the starting model if it has lower residuals. The other major application for the RSTT library is seismic event location.

However, current trends in computer architectures are leading twards system with more, but not faster. processors. Therefore, faster compute speeds must come from greater parallelism. One approach to achieve parallelism in time is with multigrid, but extending classical multigrid methods for elliptic poerators to this setting is a significant achievement. In this software, we implement a non-intrusive, optimal-scaling time-parallel method based on multigrid reduction techniques. The examples in the package demonstrate optimality of our multigrid-reduction-in-time algorithm (MGRIT) for solving a variety of parabolic equations in two and three sparial dimensions.

The latter principle is employed in both an algorithm (learnedPhyloblocks.pl) and a visualization method (panGenome.pl).

Safe operations can be enhanced by correct design of device-level control algorithms, and protocols, procedures and operator training at the control-room level, but all can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. In order to secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, we believe monitoring of command sequences must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. The method can also verify that physical infrastructure state is consistent with monitoring information and control commands exchanged between field devices and control centers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes. We implemented specification-based SCADA command analyzers using physical constraint algorithms directly in the Bro framework and Broccoli APIs for three separate scenarios: a water heater, an automated distribution system, and an over-current protection scheme. To accomplish this, we added low-level analyzers capable of examining control system-specific protocol packets for both Modbus TCP and DNP3, and also higher-level analyzers able to interpret device command and data streams within the context of each device's physical capabilities and present operational state. Thus the software that we are making available includes the Bro/Broccoli scripts for these three scenarios, as well as simulators, written in C, of those scenarios that generate sample traffic that is monitored by the Bro/Broccoli scripts. In addition, we have also implemented systems to directly pull cyber-physical information from the OSIsoft PI historian system.

The model is based on a specific formulation of the Population Balance Equation, derived for soluble particles. ISD3 solves for the size and spatial distribution of particle numbers, represented together as a particle number density (that is a function of particle location and diameter). From the number density, all other quantities, such as mass, concentration, size distribution and surface areas are derived. The model can be applied for any initial particle size distribution data by representing the data in terms of the number density. As a result, time dependent solutions can be obtained for all size ranges in a single run of the ISD3 simulation for a given particle type andmedia conditions. In the current implementation, particles are treated as spherical in shape and can be modeled as primary particles, agglomerates, or as primary particles coated with proteins. Ions are modeled as a lumped system with a uniform concentration in the liquid media. Particle transport is assumed to occur down the liquid column via diffusion and sedimentation (no fluid convection), and no aggregation/agglomeration, coagulation and break-up of the particles occur during transport. Cellular uptake kinetics of ions and particle dissolution kinetics are currently implemented using empirical models that were developed and calibrated for silver nanoparticles and ions. The ISD3 code is modular, allowing use of the existing equations for the dissolution model and ion uptake, but can be modified to include alternate models developed by the user. Application of ISD3 to another particle system would involve inputting parameters appropriate for the particles and model system. For particle uptake by cells, users have the option to use a no-flux or a perfectly absorbing ?sticky? boundary condition. For reactive boundary conditions, the user needs to modify a few lines of the code to express the desired form of the boundary condition (e.g., Robin type of boundary condition).",0.0,http://nanodose.pnnl.gov/ModelDownload.aspx,Development,"[DOE CODE,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)]"

Also, it is not intended for thermodynamic model development or for constructing phase diagrams. The main purpose of the software is to be directly coupled with a multi-physics code to provide material properties and boundary conditions for various physical phenomena. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to enhance computational performance through advanced algorithm development, such as improved estimation techniques and non-linear solvers. Various useful parameters can be provided as output from Thermochimica, such as: determination of which phases are stable at equilibrium, the mass of solution species and phases at equilibrium, mole fractions of solution phase constituents, thermochemical activities (which are related to partial pressures for gaseous species), chemical potentials of solution species and phases, and integral Gibbs energy (referenced relative to standard state).

Today FEHM is used to simulate groundwater and contaminant flow and transport in deep and shallow, fractured and un-fractured porous media throughout the US DOE complex. FEHM has proved to be a valuable asset on a variety of projects of national interest including Environmental Remediation of the Nevada Test Site, the LANL Groundwater Protection Program, geologic CO2 sequestration, Enhanced Geothermal Energy (EGS) programs, Oil and Gas production, Nuclear Waste Isolation, and Arctic Permafrost. Subsurface physics has ranged from single fluid/single phase fluid flow when simulating basin scale groundwater aquifers to complex multifluid/ multi-phase fluid flow that includes phase change with boiling and condensing in applications such as unsaturated zone surrounding nuclear waste storage facility or leakage of CO2/brine through faults or wellbores. The numerical method used in FEHM is the control volume method (CV) for fluid flow and heat transfer equations which allows FEHM to exactly enforce energy/mass conservation; while an option is available to use the finite element (FE) method for displacement equations to obtain more accurate stress calculations. In addition to these standard methods, an option to use FE for flow is available, as well as a simple Finite Difference scheme.",1601304.8,https://github.com/lanl/FEHM,Production,"[DOE CODE,Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)]"

Each microgrid controller was connected to Real-Time Simulator (Opal-RT) where the Real-Time model of microgrid was simulated. Microgrid controllers were able to control most of the assets in the model. To be able to fairly compare controller's performance each controller was evaluated using exactly the same model, with the same initial conditions and exactly the same test sequence.The microgrid evaluation test sequence lasted 100 minutes and consist of various grid disturbances to which a microgrid controller must respond. The microgrid and power system will experience multiple types of disturbances while performing dispatch functions.  Many functions are tested in grid-connected and islanded modes such as unexpended failures of generators, energy storage trip events, and large load fluctuations. The test sequence focuses on fault scenarios that cause the highest short-circuit fault current contribution; force a swing bus or generator capable of being a swing bus offline; cause the most reconfigurations; and cause conflicting objectives for the microgrid controller. During the test sequence execution multiple datapoints are being recorded and stored. During data postprocessing key performance parameters are extracted allowing quantitative comparison of performance on multiple aspects including: resiliency, fuel utilization, grid interconnection, ancillary services and power quality and eventually after summing all key performance parameters by comparing the overall result.To be able to perform such testing multiple tools had to be developed included in this repository including:- Real time model of microgrid (Urban-Banshee, Remote-smaller model)- Test sequence configuration tools- Test execution real-time scripts- Post processing scripts- Human Machine Interface software",242196.8,https://github.com/PowerSystemsHIL/EPHCC/tree/NREL_merge,Production,"[DOE CODE,National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]"

The simulation domain can include the magnetic separatrix, magnetic axis and the biased material wall. XGC can run in full-f, total-delta-f, and conventional delta-f mode. The ion is kinetic always except ETG simulation. The electron can be adiabatic, fluid, drift kinetic, or gyrokinetic (for ETG).XGC is written in Fortran 90 and is designed for HPCs utilizing MPI, OpenMP, CUDA (GPU), OpenACC (GPU), and vectorization (Intel MIC-KNL). The weak scaling is roughly linear to the maximal nodes of leading HPCs in US.There several versions of XGCs for different purpose: XGC0 is earlist version of XGC0 which is designed for neoclassical transport in the tokamak edge. It uses full-f method, and 00-mode electrostatic field is solved only. RMP and current response can be calculated with coupling with M3D.XGC1 is for turbulence simulation with low parallel wavenumber. Piecewise field following coordinates are used to handle low k-parallel perturbation with small (~64) number of toroidal resolution. In total-delta-f method, it utilizes phase space grid in addition to particles, to handel non-maxwellian distribution in the tokamak edge.XGCa is axisymmetric version of XGC1 to simulate neoclassical transport.References: [1] S.

Small commercial buildings typically do not have the budgets or business economics to allow investing in energy efficiency enhancements the building retro-commissioning provides. In addition, they do not have in-house staff with expertise in building systems who can perform building retro-commissioning or identify energy efficiency improvement opportunities. The solution to this problem is to develop a turn-key hardware/software solution (the RCx Sensor Suitcase) that can be used by non-experts to automatically generate low and no-cost energy efficiency rec commendations that will improve building operating costs, occupant comfort and building energy performance. This is a joint project between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, leading the development of the software and analysis elements, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), leading the development of the hardware and sensor elements with an associated table-based configuration support tool. The project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. This software package was developed as a proof-of-concept prototype for the sensor suitcase software component.

Gkeyll contains ab-initio and novel implementations of a number of algorithms, and perhaps is unique in using a JIT compiled typeless dynamic language for its implementation.One of the main innovations in Gkeyll is the blurring of boundaries between user written code (i.e. input files) and backend solver code. In fact, there is no difference: the front-end and back-end are written in the same programming language, opening up a very powerful way of composing simulations. All solver objects (grids, data-structures, updaters) can be queried, modified and controlled by the user, allowing complete control over the full simulation cycle. The use of the highly optimized Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled LuaJIT as the main programming language ensures that user written code remains highly efficient. Of course, core kernels can always be written in C/C++ and hooked in via LuaJIT?s powerful FFI facilities.",0.0,https://theory.pppl.gov/research/research.php?rid=10#h44,Development,"[DOE CODE,Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)]"

The kinetic post-processor of the suite, NOVA-K, analyses those solutions to find their stability properties. NOVA-K evaluates the wave particle interaction of the eigenmodes such as Toroidal Alfvn Eigenmodes (TAEs) or Reversed Shear Alfvn Eigenmodes (RSAEs) by employing the quadratic form with the perturbed distribution function coming from the drift kinetic equations.  In computations of the hot ion contribution to the growth rate NOVA-K makes use of the constant of motion to represent the hot particle drift orbits. NOVA is routinely used for AE structure computations and comparisons with the experimentally observed instabilities [M. A. Van Zeeland et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 135001 (2006), G. J. Kramer, Phys. Plasmas 13, 056104 (2006)]. The main limitations of NOVA code are caused by neglecting thermal ion finite Larmor radius (FLR), toroidal rotation, and drift effects for the eigenmode computations. Therefore it can not describe accurately radiative damping for example. Finite element methods are used in radial direction and Fourier harmonics are used in poloidal and toroidal directions.NOVA-K is able to predict various kinetic growth and damping rates perturbatively, such as the phase space gradient drive from energetic particles, continuum damping, radiative damping, ion/electron Landau damping and trapped electron collisional damping.

An important difference between Metamesh and other mesh libraries is that Metamesh does not provide a specific mesh format, in the usual sense, or tools or a GUI by which users build specific meshes. Rather, it provides a mechanism by which mesh formats themselves can be built, based on their constituent parts and the relationships between them.Consider that a mesh in up to three space dimensions can, in principle, contain nodes (0d entities, or points), edges (1d entities), faces (2d entities), and cells (3d, or volumetric, entities). A node might be defined in terms of (x), (x,y), or (x,y,z) in Cartesian coordinates; or perhaps something else, in a different coordinate system. An edge is typically defined from two nodes; say, edge E goes from node A=(ax,ay) to node B=(bx,by). Faces can reasonably be defined in terms of nodes or edges, and cells in terms of nodes, edges, or faces. Note also that someone might wish to support general faces or cells, or only specific variants - say, triangular faces and tetrahedral cells, or quadrilateral faces and hexahedral cells. Or, perhaps, both triangular and quadrilateral faces (but no others), with prisms for each cell. Consider also that a mesh can have the same or a lesser dimension than that of its enclosing space. In 3d, for example, one could have a full 3d mesh, a 2d sheet mesh with no cells, a 1d parametrized curve with neither faces nor cells, or even a 1d point cloud. And, in addition to defining a mesh scheme, a user might wish to place additional data onto one or more mesh entities. Imagine, for example, a velocity at each node, a flux across each edge or face, and a mass or average density per cell. Metamesh supports all of this, through the use of C++ class and function templates, and template metaprogramming techniques. Programmers begin with constructs that Metamesh provides (or, users can define their own), and assemble them in particular ways in order to create particular mesh formats. Metamesh then provides functionality automatically to meshes that are constructed in this manner. Finally, Metamesh provides very general functions for spinning, extruding, visualizing, and performing input/output of whatever meshes a user builds with it.",7052.8,https://github.com/staleyLANL/metamesh,Production,"[DOE CODE,Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)]"

At this time it remains a test-bed to experiment with various algorithms using fully asynchronous runtime systems. Currently, Quinoa consists of the following tools: (1) Walker, a numerical integrator for systems of stochastic differential equations in time. It is a mathematical tool to analyze and design the behavior of stochastic differential equations. It allows the estimation of arbitrary coupled statistics and probability density functions and is currently used for the design of statistical moment approximations for multiple mixing materials in variable-density turbulence. (2) Inciter, an overdecomposition-aware finite element field solver for partial differential equations using 3D unstructured grids. Inciter is used to research asynchronous mesh-based algorithms and to experiment with coupling asynchronous to bulk-synchronous parallel code. Two planned new features of Inciter, compared to the previous release (LA-CC-16-015), to be implemented in 2017, are (a) a simple Navier-Stokes solver for ideal single-material compressible gases, and (b) solution-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which enables dynamically concentrating compute resources to regions with interesting physics. Using the NS-AMR problem we plan to explore how to scale such high-load-imbalance simulations, representative of large production multiphysics codes, to very large problems on very large computers using an asynchronous runtime system. (3) RNGTest, a test harness to subject random number generators to stringent statistical tests enabling quantitative ranking with respect to their quality and computational cost. (4) UnitTest, a unit test harness, running hundreds of tests per second, capable of testing serial, synchronous, and asynchronous functions. (5) MeshConv, a mesh file converter that can be used to convert 3D tetrahedron meshes from and to either of the following formats: Gmsh, http://www.geuz.org/gmsh, Netgen, http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/netgen-mesher, ExodusII, http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii, HyperMesh, http://www.altairhyperworks.com/product/HyperMesh.",130020.8,https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa,Production,"[DOE CODE,Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)]"

As an augmented version of the Dutch company, Deltares?s, environmental hydrodynamics code, Delft3D, SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM includes a new module that simulates energy conversion (momentum withdrawal) by MHK current energy conversion devices with commensurate changes in the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.  SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM modified the Delft3D flexible mesh flow solver, DFlowFM.The Following is a description of Deltares?s open-source code Delft3D from which Delft3D-CEC is built upon.?Delft3D is a world leading 3D modeling suite to investigate hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology and water quality for fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments. As per 1 January 2011, the Delft3D flow (FLOW), morphology (MOR) and waves (WAVE) modules are available in open source.The software is used and has proven his capabilities on many places around the world, like the Netherlands, USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Venice, etc. The software is continuously improved and developed with innovating advanced modelling techniques as consequence of the research work of our institute and to stay world leading.The FLOW module is the heart of Delft3D and is a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) hydrodynamic (and transport) simulation program which calculates non-steady flow and transport phenomena resulting from tidal and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear, boundary fitted grid or spherical coordinates. In 3D simulations, the vertical grid is defined following the so-called sigma coordinate approach or Z-layer approach. The MOR module computes sediment transport (both suspended and bed total load) and morphological changes for an arbitrary number of cohesive and non-cohesive fractions. Both currents and waves act as driving forces and a wide variety of transport formulae have been incorporated. For the suspended load this module connects to the 2D or 3D advection-diffusion solver of the FLOW module; density effects may be taken into account. An essential feature of the MOR module is the dynamic feedback with the FLOW and WAVE modules, which allow the flows and waves to adjust themselves to the local bathymetry and allows for simulations on any time scale from days (storm impact) to centuries (system dynamics). It can keep track of the bed composition to build up a stratigraphic record. The MOR module may be extended to include extensive features to simulate dredging and dumping scenarios.For over 30 years Deltares has been in the forefront of these types of combined morphological simulation techniques.?",0.0,https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d/home,Development,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

ECO2N V2.0 is an enhanced version of the previous ECO2N V1.0 module (Pruess, 2005). It expands the temperature range up to about 300oC whereas V1.0 can only be used for temperatures below about 110oC. V2.0 includes a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of H2O - NaCl - CO2 mixtures, that reproduces fluid properties largely within experimental error for the temperature, pressure and salinity conditions 10 C < T < 300 C, P < 600 bar, and salinity up to halite saturation. This includes density, viscosity, and specific enthalpy of fluid phases as functions of temperature, pressure, and composition, as well as partitioning of mass components H2O, NaCl and CO2 among the different phases. In particular, V2.0 accounts for the effects of water on the thermophysical properties of the CO2-rich phase, which was ignored in V1.0, using a model consistent with the solubility models developed by Spycher and Pruess (2005, 2010). In terms of solubility models, V2.0 uses the same model for partitioning of mass components among the different phases (Spycher and Pruess, 2005) as V1.0 for the low temperature range (<99oC) but uses a new model (Spycher and Pruess, 2010) for the high temperature range (>109oC). In the transition range (99-109oC), a smooth interpolation is applied to estimate the partitioning as a function of the temperature. Flow processes can be modeled isothermally or non-isothermally, and phase conditions represented may include a single (aqueous or CO2-rich) phase, as well as two-phase (brine-CO2) mixtures. Fluid phases may appear or disappear in the course of a simulation, and solid salt may precipitate or dissolve. Note that the model cannot be applied to subcritical conditions that involves both liquid and gaseous CO2 unless thermol process is ignored (i.e.,isothermal run).

ADAPT can utilize any simulation tool which meets a minimal set of requirements. ADAPT is based on the concept of DET which uses explicit modeling of the deterministic dynamic processes that take place during a nuclear reactor plant system (or other complex system) evolution along with stochastic modeling. When DET are used to model different aspects of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), all accident progression scenarios starting from an initiating event are considered simultaneously. The DET branching occurs at user specified times and/or when an action is required by the system and/or the operator. These outcomes then decide how the dynamic system variables will evolve in time for each DET branch. Since two different outcomes at a DET branching may lead to completely different paths for system evolution, the next branching for these paths may occur not only at different times, but can be based on different branching criteria. The computational infrastructure allows for flexibility in ADAPT to link with different system simulation codes, parallel processing of the scenarios under consideration, on-line scenario management (initiation as well as termination), analysis of results, and user friendly graphical capabilities. The ADAPT system is designed for a distributed computing environment; the scheduler can track multiple concurrent branches simultaneously. The scheduler is modularized so that the DET branching strategy can be modified (e.g. biasing towards the worst case scenario/event). Independent database systems store data from the simulation tasks and the DET structure so that the event tree can be constructed and analyzed later. ADAPT is provided with a user-friendly client which can easily sort through and display the results of an experiment, precluding the need for the user to manually inspect individual simulator runs.",0.0,http://www.sandia.gov/adapt,Development,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

Alfalfa has use cases beyond control system testing. One example is building fault detection, where physical building performance can be compared to simulated values in realtime, indicating where there may be a problem in the building. Another use case is informing predictive control systems, where near future events are simulated to premptively guide control decisions in the real building.This software is web based and designed to be self service. Users of Alfalfa can upload an OpenStudio building model and begin communicating with the simulated building without any advanced setup or configuration, as if they were communicating a real building control system.

Mixed cultures of microbial species are increasingly used to carry out a specific task in lieu of engineering a single microbe to do the same task. However, knowing how different species' metabolisms will integrate to reach a desired outcome is a difficult problem that has been studied in great detail--but only using steady-state models. Mixed cultures used for biotechnology processes, as well as microbial communities that exist in nature and crop agriculture, are metabolically dynamic systems. Studying the temporal substrate utilization by individuals is individuals in mixed cultures is an important first step in developing approaches to better model these biochemical processes and microbial communities found in nature. The 2017-004 software is comprised of four custom iPython notebooks that were used for all computational tasks in the experimental work described in Dynamic substrate preferences predict metabolic properties of a simple microbial consortium (Erbilgin et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2017). The results indicate that a significant portion of a model community's overall metabolism can be predicted based on the metabolism of the individuals. The results further suggest that, when the mixed culture's substrate depletion significantly deviates from such a prediction, this may highlight potential metabolic pathways affected by species-species microbial interactions, leading to hypotheses about how a particular microbial community's structure and function may be modulated to perform a particular biotechnological goal.",501.6,https://github.com/biorack/bmc_bioinf_2016_erbilgin,Production,"[DOE CODE,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)]"

Log messages are then assigned to an event, which is a collection of log messages related to a single potential attack. Meta-analysis rules run on the collection of all logs within an event to correlate multiple related logs into a single known attack signature.

The length of time that the quarantine lasts for is based on the severity and frequency of the attack, along with historical information on the attacker and any third party provided threat intelligence data that the system has gathered. An additional random length of time is added to each quarantine so the algorithm cannot easily be learned and bypassed by a persistent attacker.

Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles that could be applied to assessing the effectiveness of data visualizations in a more rapid and generalizable manner. The visual saliency model for data visualizations described here addresses this need for evaluation tools. Visual saliency models assess the visual features (e.g. color, contrast, edges) of an image to predict which areas of that image will draw a viewer?s attention.  Providing predictions of where viewers will look in a visualization based on the saliency of the various regions and elements in that image could help designers to assess whether or not their design will draw the viewer?s attention as intended. The Data Visualization Saliency model, a saliency model for data visualizations, consists of two parts: a text saliency map and a modified version of the Itti, Koch and Niebur model [1]. The final saliency map is a linear combination of the two. The text saliency map is created from an algorithm that computes the likelihood of belonging to a text region for each pixel of an input visualization image. The modified Itti model transforms the original input image to a representation in CIE LAB color space, which provides an accurate representation of perceptual color opponency.For a given input data visualization image, the Data Visualization Saliency model computes and returns the visualization saliency map highlighting areas of the data visualization that will draw a viewer?s attention.

We developed a method by which an introspection application may be coupled with a hypervisor to ?reach into? the VM with minimal intrusiveness to collect data critical to the reconstruction of events, files, and operations. Such a capability is required to take advantage of the hypervisor as an instrumentation platform and to integrate that data with more traditional collection mechanisms. The concept of a VM serviced by a lightweight hypervisor is a relatively new paradigm for forensic practitioners. Traditional forensic techniques, based on assumptions that the filesystem was directly interacting with the hardware through an abstraction, afforded the forensic practitioner the assumption that there was nothing controlling the application below the filesystem. This is not the case when using virtualized technologies. Hypervisors can covertly monitor, introspect and interact with the guest in a transparent fashion. The problems of storage and collection of actionable data are exhausting. The current challenge is most hypervisors do not expose a useful application programming interface (API) at a sufficient level to do transparent, fine-grained and customizable introspection. Scalable VM instrumentation and introspection at an in-depth level requires fast handling of events, as well as direct access to VM state. Furthermore, deep introspection benefits greatly from the ability to gather data from the hardware during the VM?s exit to the hypervisor. All of this requires identical access to the system as the hypervisor itself; improper use of this ability could easily cause system instability. It is for this reason we believe that the hypervisor developers have been hesitant to grant this much control through their APIs. However, our approach leverages other means to collect and monitor the guests in a targeted fashion. Virtual machine introspection (VMI) is a technique used to monitor the runtime state of a system-level virtual machine. The runtime state can be may include processor registers, memory, disk, network, and any other hardware-level eventsA review of research literature and current VMI technologies exposed several limitations and tradeoffs in VMI approaches, including: the use of in-guest agents; kernel to user space transitions (dramatically slowing down processing); VMI tool pre-configuration requirements; hypervisor version lock-in or source code patching; reliance on operating system symbols; limited processor features due to hypervisor (even if the hardware could do more).To address these constraints, a VMI tool was envisioned to provide the cloud forensic capabilities while having as few of these limitations as possible. The Kernel-based Virtual Machine Introspection (KVMi) tool was developed for hypervisors on Intel?s x86-64 architecture. To meet performance, scoping and use-case demands, the follow criteria were applied to KVMi to support live, forensic data collection:?Shall not require in-guest agents.?Shall work with any recent version of modern hypervisors.?Shall introspect upon any guest (VM) running modern versions of Windows, Linux and OS X.?Shall have the ability to find and track operating system artifacts?Shall not require operating system symbol files.?Shall be able to fully handle VM-exits, bypassing execution of the hypervisor if necessary, to facilitate new features the hypervisor may not support.?Shall be compilable/loadable on a running system with standard build tools.",38273.6,https://ip.sandia.gov/contact.do,Production,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

It further evaluates the corresponding thermochemical properties of water consistent with the CODATA recommendations (Cox et al., 1989). The IAPWS-95 model is based on a model equation for the dimensionless Helmholtz energy for which the primary variables are the inverse reduced temperature and reduced density. Here is the absolute temperature (K), is density (kg/m3), and the subscript refers to the critical point of water (647.096 K and 22.064 MPa pressure in this model, for which is 322 kg/m3). The code solves four basic types of problems, distinguished by the specified inputs: 1, Temperature (K) and density (kg/m3) or reduced density2. Temperature (K) and pressure (MPa). 3. Temperature (K) on the saturation (liquid-vapor equilibrium) curve 4. Pressure (MPa) on the saturation curveEach type of problem is run using a corresponding input (text) file. All but the first type of problem require iteration. For example, to solve for desired temperature and pressure, the reduced density must be adjusted to give the desired pressure. Iteration is accomplished using the Newton-Raphson method, though the secant method is also used in solving the fourth type of problem. H2OI95 has been used to conduct numerical studies of convergence and the problem of multiple numerical solutions, only some of which correspond to valid results. Obtaining valid results depends mainly on appropriate choice of starting values. The default values in H2OI95 appear to consistently lead to generally desired results. With modification (not addressed here), H2OI95 can be used to support SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992) and similar codes that compute chemical thermodynamic properties of species and reactions over a wide range of temperature and pressure (273.16-1273K and 0-1000 MPa).",15.2,https://github.com/LLNL/H2OI95,Production,"[DOE CODE,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)]"

Unfortunately, the use of MS has been limited for lack of software tools to visualize, manipulate, store and transfer MS data. Ben Bowen, Oliver Ruebel and colleagues made a huge advance on the resolution of these limitations with the invention of OpenMSI (#2013-004), a computational method that makes the handling of these very large files (up to 50 Tb) much easier, especially for scientists with limited background in bioinformatics or sophisticated software applications of the type needed to handle such data files. With the OpenMSI Arrayed Analysis Tool (OMAAT, #2016-188) invention, the authors take MS data analysis one step further by providing tolls for automatic sample position optimization and ion selection. Even though sample deposition technologies have improved greatly, there is always the chance of encountering outliers in a predefined roster, especially in very large sample sets.

It takes HD images of the sky as input and conducts image pre-processing to correct image geometry, correct deformation caused by fish-eye lenses and remove extraneous parts of the image. It calculates the location of the sun and removes it to reduce distortion.   A cloud detection/tracking algorithm was developed using both spectral and spatial information for discriminating clouds and clear sky based on their shape, size, and color.  The software repeats the process with updated images generated every 30 seconds (or less) and then tracks the clouds as they move through the region of interest.  Cloud motion determination is based on finding the maximal normalized cross-correlation between sequential images.  The resolution of multiple imager views of clouds in the sky allows the system to estimate cloud height and categorize them into low or high cloud regimes that move at different rates. Additional input data on solar irradiance from pyranometers is ingested.  The algorithm then  determines the transmissivity of light and uses machine-learning techniques to predict the amount of available global horizontal irradiance (GHI) that will be available on the ground. Images from individual sets of cameras are stitched together to form regional forecasts that cover both generating facilities and distributed solar resources.

DEGAS 2 is written in a macro-enhanced'' version of FORTRAN via the FWEB library, providing an object oriented capability and simplifying tedious tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation and the reading and written of self-describing binary files. As a result, the code is extremely flexible and can be readily adapted to problems seemingly far removed from tokamak divertor physics, e.g., its use in simulating the diffusive evaporation of lithium in NSTX [3] and LTX [4]. DEGAS 2 has been extensively verified, as is documented in its User's Manual [5]. Experimental validation has been largely centered on the Gas Puff Imaging (GPI) technique for visualizing plasma turbulence in the tokamak edge. The validation against deuterium gas puff data from NSTX is described in the paper by B. Cao et al. [6] Analogous work with both deuterium and helium has been carried out on Alcator C-Mod. A related application of DEGAS 2 is in the interpretation of data from the Edge Neutral Density Diagnostic on NSTX [7] and NSTX-U. DEGAS 2 has been applied to many other devices, including JT-60U [8], ADITYA [9], and FRC experiments at Tri-Alpha Energy [10]. Neutral transport codes are frequently coupled to plasma simulation codes to allow a self-consistent plasma-neutral solution to be computed. Initially, DEGAS 2 was coupled to UEDGE [11]. More recently, DEGAS 2 has been coupled to the drift-kinetic XGC0 [12], and has been used in the development and testing of the simplified built-in neutral transport module in XGC1 [13].

In particular, we ask: The methodology described here offers a solution to the problem of how to conduct Tafel analysis, which is used in determining electrocatalyst performance, in a quantitative manner, rather than through the qualitative guesswork it currently requires. This enables the measurement of electrocatalyst Tafel slopes and their associated parameters in a way that avoids the introduction of researcher bias, a problem to which current methods of Tafel fitting are prone. This procedure should significantly improve the ability of researchers working in the field of electrochemical energy conversion to rate and compare the catalyst materials being developed, advancing the characterization toolkit available to experimental electrochemists. This work is born out of our general hypothesis that it should be possible to determine the proper regions for unambiguously fitting Tafel data by applying some set of physical constraints that link aspects of a Tafel plot to its corresponding J-V polarization curve. This algorithm applies such constraints and achieves the extraction of Tafel slopes in a wholly quantifiable and reliable fashion. Verification of this approach is achieved by pairing the theory with experiment, as the algorithm was tested using experimentally acquired data of three distinct, electrochemical reactions: platinum hydrogen evolution, iridium-catalyzed oxygen evolution, and platinum-catalyzed dioxygen reduction. For each of these cases, the algorithm predicts the same Tafel slope as those reported in long-established bodies of electrochemical literature, results suggesting the general applicability of this method for determining electrocatalyst Tafel slopes.",0.0,https://github.com/MEG-LBNL/Tafel_Fitter,Production,"[DOE CODE,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)]"

The statusMessageReporting package was created to facilitate rich exception reporting by C functions to their calling functions.The statusMessageReporting (smr) package allows a function, called the generator, to communicate an exception to its calling function using a statusMessageReporting report.

Since libraries are often developed independent of one another, they often use the same code values to represent different exceptions (e.g., one library may define the code 3 to be an error opening a file while another library may define the code 3 to be a divide-by-zero error) which is why the libraryID is needed.

Open-source software disrupts that process and moves the development effort toward capabilities that can be used by the broader scientific community. The broader scientific community can then, in turn, contribute to and collaborate on efforts to improve the process for the individual researcher and program. Researchers will be able to do more science with fewer resources without the burden of developing code from the ground up. For any software to be adopted by a community, it needs to have a solid framework that will be easy to use and provide clear benefit worthy of the investment in participating. In support of this goal, our Atmospheric Data Community Toolkit will leverage the knowledge gained from the successful adoption of the Python Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) to build that framework. The framework will provide the environment to enable collaboration in the research community. This environment will allow the development of tools for funded programs, as well as provide researchers in the scientific community with code for advancing their work.

If this works, we have set the framework for the development and dissemination of a robust open-source code called wavepy that is tailored to the data analysis for imaging and beam characterization using grating interferometry. Wavepy consists of a Python library for data analysis of x-ray grating interferometry. The library takes advantage of the python programming language capabilities and flexibility, and aims to be easy to collaborate, distribute, and integrate with other imaging packages. The main reason for using Python is twofold: to take advantage of a widely used language in the scientific community, and also to make extensive use of the existing Python libraries for numerical calculation and plotting, namely numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Installation is facilitated by using conda to solve dependencies. The development makes use of git for version control and collaborative development. The code is hosted in the GitHub repository https://github.com/APS-XSD-OPT-Group/wavepy. One of the reasons for using Python is to be able to integrate wavey with other projects, mainly DXchange to seamlessly load images of different formats, and TomoPy for tomography.

Most engineering efforts, however, consist of laborious and inefficient trial-and-error of target pathways, due in part to the lack of methodologies that can comprehensively assess pathway properties in thermodynamics and kinetics.Here we introduce a computational toolbox, PathParser, which integrates multiple important functions for pathway analysis including thermodynamics analysis, kinetics-based protein cost optimization and robustness analysis. Specifically, PathParser enables optimization of the driving force of a pathway by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of least thermodynamically favorable reaction. In addition, based on reaction thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics, it can compute the minimal enzyme protein cost that supports metabolic flux, and evaluate pathway stability and flux in response to enzyme concentration perturbations. For more details please see the paper A generalized computational framework to streamline thermodynamics and kinetics analysis of metabolic pathways at the link below. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717619302587This toolbox may have broad application in metabolic engineering and systems biology in microbial biomanufacturing systems.",0.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401243,Development,"[DOE CODE,National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]"

The user interacts with a canvas, where they position icons representing pieces of data. A unique feature is that the data can be heterogeneous -- some of the icons can represent images, while others could be text, audio, etc. After the user positions items on the screen to their satisfaction, they press a button to commit the X/Y coordinates of each icon to a central database, where these positions are added as a latent feature to each item. The user also has the option to request new, untouched data be added to the canvas, and the system positions each new item according the pattern it has learned from the original data. Another unique feature is that the user can ask the system to refine their initial rough work. The system uses information theoretic measures to determine which features in the database best explain how the user positioned the icons on the screen. It then attempts to *incrementally* optimize the positions on the screen to best explain those features it isolated. The user can then adjust the positions to correct the system, or the user can request additional refinement to further optimize the positions. In this way, by incorporating user feedback and crowdsourced features, the system reduces the time required for a user to develop a rich classification scheme for large amounts of data.

The Moirai are the Greek Fates, and this software is named Moirai to represent the fundamental influence of land data inputs on model outcomes. The primary function of the Moirai LDS is to combine spatially explicit input data (e.g., raster images) with tabular input data (e.g., crop price table) to generate tabular output data for a suite of variables. Some of these outputs replace the data provide by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), and other data replace and augment the original GCAM GIS processing. The Moirai LDS output data are aggregated by Geographic Land Unit (GLU) within each country. The GLU coverage is an input to the Moirai LDS (as a thematic raster image and an associated CSV file that maps the thematic integers to names), and the GLU boundaries can be determined arbitrarily. Previous versions of GCAM (and Moirai LDS) used only bioclimatic Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) and corresponding data that were provided by GTAP, as the GLUs. As a result, some AEZ terminology still exists in the code, but this terminology now refers more generally to GLUs. The Moirai LDS now enables any set of boundaries to be used as GLUs (including AEZs), allowing for more flexible generation of land use region boundaries (defined as the intersection of GLUs with geopolitical regions). The current default set of GLUs is the same set of 235 global watersheds as used by the GCAM water module. The GCAM 5.1 geopolitical regions (32 or 14) are included and used as inputs to Moirai to generate a mapping file between the Moirai outputs, which are at the level of the intersection between the GLUs and the country boundaries, and the geopolitical regions. The diagnostics scripts use this geopolitical region mapping in some cases. Moirai can also recalibrate three of the outputs (crop production, harvested area, and land rent) to a specified year that is the center of a five-year averaging window. No recalibration retains the circa 2000, 7-year average of the source data. The cucrrency-year for land rent can also be specified, and the default is 2001 to match the GTAP data.",7752.0,https://github.com/JGCRI/moirai,Production,"[DOE CODE,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)]"

Standardizing these sequences will allow for a more efficient product delivery mechanism where the sequences are programmed and tested centrally by each manufacturer, and then distributed to their dealers/engineering contractors. This approach would minimize the need for each installer to re-interpret and program the sequences, reduces risk of errors, and reduces the time required for commissioning in the field.To achieve this goal, a performance validation method is needed to provide independent confirmation that each manufacturer has programmed the Guideline 36 sequences accurately. A standardized method of test would also avoid the need for manual interpretation (and the associated human variability) that is required with typical functional testing approaches by automating the inputs and the range of expected responses. This software guideline36_conformance_test has been developed to conduct standardized, repeatable and manufacturer independent tests to validate that a BAS controller has been programmed in conformance with Guideline 36.

The BEAM model shifts some of the behavioral emphasis in MATSim from across-day planning to within-day planning, where agents dynamically respond to the state of the system during the mobility simulation.

Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms such as Smith-Waterman, for long alignments, the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first GPU optimization of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, named LOGAN. Results show that our high-performance multi-GPU LOGAN implementation achieves up to 181.6 GCUPS and speed-ups up to 6.6x and 30.7x using 1 and 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100, respectively, over the state-of-the-art software running on two IBM Power9 processors using 168 threads, with equivalent accuracy.

Location, size, type of system, and a number of other criteria need to be considered. The objective of this program is to determine the optimal size (capacity, Kilowatt (kW)) of a renewable energy generator, based on minimizing life cycle cost (LCC). The reason for developing such a program is driven by three major issues. First, the need to evaluate a very large number (tens of thousands) of project opportunity sites. Next, the need for data transfer efficiency and computational efficiency in on-line and mobile applications. And lastly, to increase the accuracy of screening studies, which are the earliest indicators of project opportunities. Many existing programs require the user to enter the size (kW) of the renewable energy system in order to start calculations.  However, there are many factors that affect what the size should be including: renewable energy resources, utility rates, initial and maintenance costs, and economic parameters. NREL scientists have developed an algorithm that addresses the previous three major issues. Lifecycle cost is calculated based on: the sum of initial cost, plus the present value of operations and maintenance costs, costs involved with purchasing power from the utility company, and revenue involved with the sale of excess electricity back to the utility.The algorithm computes the derivative of an equation for LCC as a function of the size of the renewable energy generator (P), then sets the derivative equal to zero (dLCC/dP=0), and solves for the value of (P) that minimizes life cycle cost. Once the size (P) has been determined, other project details may be calculated. This algorithm develops a closed-form solution for the optimal size of a renewable energy generator. Having a closed-form solution avoids problems of scale and speed that can be encountered with optimization algorithms. Incentives that affect initial cost or provide a payment for energy production are also represented.Because the algorithm was built in terms of analytics (calculus) and not numeric methods, it can be easily implemented in any platform such as spreadsheets or mobile computing applications. The program is very accurate as long as the simplifying assumptions in the derivation apply: constant load (during daylight hours for PV, all hours for wind); a single rate for all power purchased from the utility; and a single rate for all power sold back to the utility.  The program calculates energy saved on-site and energy sold back to the utility using a duration curve based on capacity factor.

The quality of openly available data is typically much lower than that of the IMS, given the wide variety of experimental goals and deployment conditions. Incorporating additional stations without properly identifying and mitigating data quality problems can actually degrade overall monitoring capabilities. Towards that objective, Pycheron, a python-based library for seismic data quality control (QC) was developed. Pycheron began as a translation of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Modular Utility for STAtistical kNowledge Gathering (MUSTANG) package (written in R) into Python, but has grown into a stand-alone package that includes significant additional functionality. Pycheron is intended to be implemented at the beginning of the data processing pipeline. The objectives of the library are to: automatically assess data quality and instrumentation health; maintain the highest quality of data possible; identify specific and key problems; alert downstream processing algorithms to any degradation in quality; improve our ability to process orders of magnitudes more data; and, serve as a basic service that all data processing within our program builds upon. Pycheron calculates metrics characterizing quality over time as well as creating QC masks to identify each interval with a QC problem.

Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Argonne has developed a full life-cycle model called GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation). It allows researchers and analysts to evaluate various vehicle and fuel combinations on a full fuel-cycle/vehicle-cycle basis. The first version of GREET was released in 1996. Since then, Argonne has continued to update and expand the model. GREET.Net provides the user with an easy to use and fully graphical toolbox to perform life cycle analysis simulations of alternative transportation fuels and vehicle technologies in a matter of a few clicks. It provides a comprehensive, life-cycle-based approach to compare the energy use and emissions of conventional and advanced vehicle technologies.

Ahardware implementation of ZFP has the potential to substantially improve HPC application performance.Hardware compression speedup over software alone on a single CPU core ranges from 15x for 1-Darrays to over 200x for 3-D arrays.The implementation of ZFP is sourced in SystemC to facilitate its evaluation in various architectures. Theencode pipeline consists of several modules. Uncompressed blocks of floating-point numbers in IEEEformat flow into the pipeline in a stream and a compressed bitstream flows out from the pipeline. Thedecode pipeline is the inverse of the encode pipeline. A modular design enables formats other than IEEE(such as posits) to be considered with minor adaptations. Best performance will be realized from thehardware ZFP unit when batches of blocks are processed at a time. The implementation supports 1-D, 2-D and 3-D blocks of floating-point numbers.The hardware implementation of ZFP has been validated with the software implementation of ZFP. C++template parameters are used to specify the bit width of floating-point numbers and the array dimensionof the encoder.

With the LiME framework, architectural ideas can be prototyped in great detail yet with sufficient performance to support realistic evaluation on long running applications. LiME consists of two fundamental components: 1) the hardware and OS infrastructure for the emulator, and 2) a suite of benchmark applications to assist in characterizing the performance of current and future computer architectures.

The tooling around these newfeatures (the extended Berkley Packet Filter or eBPF for short) is not matureand is difficult to use. Benefits from eBPF are especially hard to realizewhile trying to do large scale deployments and integrate with existing metricanalysis stacks. A tool was needed to enable loading and collecting data fromeBPF programs on large scale HPC systems.Given the problems above it was obvious we needed some wrapper program tocompile, load, and collect data from eBPF programs running in the kernel. Thistool needed to be lightweight without a heavy set of dependencies, relativelystable between different kernel versions, and integrate nicely with existingwidely used metric collection tools.We wrote a program that wraps the eBPF tooling and sends data to our metricgathering tool. eBPF programs are either compiled using the host compilerstack, or loaded in the kernel directly from an object file. These programs arethen attached to the system calls that we want to profile. Whenever thesesystem calls are run, the eBPF program collects information of interest andwrites that to memory. Our wrapper program polls these memory locations, readsand formats the data, then sends the information to a local unix socket. Ourother monitoring tools are configured to read from that socket and send it tothe rest of our metric monitoring stack for analysis.",0.0,https://github.com/olcf/greggd,Production,"[DOE CODE,Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]"

Although its primary target is the latest version TOUGH3, `toughio` can also be used to read/write TOUGH2 input/output files. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, only PyTOUGH offers an exhaustive number of features to carry out a complete TOUGH simulation using a scripting language. `toughio` and PyTOUGH share the same objectives, yet with different approaches and philosophies. On the one hand, a PyTOUGH mesh is represented as a MULGRAPH geometry where elements can be unstructured horizontally but only layered vertically. It also checks that the model parameters are valid to ensure that a TOUGH simulation runs smoothly. On the other hand, although it provides basic meshing features, `toughio` mostly relies on common third-party softwares (e.g. Abaqus, FLAC3D, Gmsh, LaGriT) to generate the mesh by importing and converting it to a TOUGH mesh, which also conveniently facilitates the coupling of TOUGH with any other simulator that also supports the same mesh formats. Besides, `toughio` is designed to be just a TOUGH input and output file reader/writer. It assumes that the user knows what he is doing and does not verify the validity of the model parameters (`toughio` does verify the functional arguments).",0.0,https://github.com/keurfonluu/toughio,Production,"[DOE CODE,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)]"

Note that (1) the prognostic CO2configuration of E3SM has not been scientifically validated, and (2) the regridding of emissionfiles as currently implemented is not mass-conserving and is intended as a temporary workaround.We do not advise using E3SMv1.1 for fully-coupled carbon cycle simulations where mass conservationis critical, but it is suitable for enabling use of the 3D CO2 tracer for diagnostic and testing purposes.Several bugs found after v1.0 have been fixed in this tag and changes made to default settings, including:    EAM: adding limiters to avoid bad extrapolation in RRTMG, fixing an error in the calculation of NIR    reflectance that affects cloud fields derived from MODIS simulator.    ELM: fixing surface water and lakes, increasing the land field name size, fixing a memory leak in    ELM CNStateType, fixing a snow compaction bug that was resulting in sporadic unphysical snow depths,    adding a water budget in the land model (and fixing a water conservation error)    MPAS-O: preventing thermo energy conservation errors by lowering the permitted surface flux error    in the mushy layer picard iteration to 0.9*ferrmax, fixing a small bug in marine BGC,    MPAS-SeaIce: Turning off mpas-seaice history files by default    MOSART: Replacing the low-res (half-degree) MOSART fileIn addition, the budget output has been turned on by default for any fully coupled case, and CIME wasmodified to remove a bad term from E3SM water budgets. The CCSM_CO2_PPMV is now set correctly in BGC cases. A bugfix for the IEFLX output is included and the timestep for the EC60to30 mesh has beenupdated.

It is developed to simulate microstructural evolution in materials during irradiation.  KSOME is developed from ground up with priority given to the flexibility, ease of upgradability, and computation efficiency, in that order. With previously developed simulation codes, various processes (more precisely, the diffusion-reaction processes) that can occur in a system were hardwired into the code. Hence, to perform higher fidelity simulations, a significant coding effort was required every time to incorporate either a more accurate description of existing processes or new processes. With KSOME, the necessity for frequent code upgrades whenever there is a need to perform higher fidelity simulations is either eliminated or reduced significantly.  In KSOME, the categories of various diffusion-reaction processes and the data-management system are hardwired, while the execution of the diffusion-reaction processes specific to a system is specified via input files. In the present version of KSOME, the analytical expression required to calculate defect interaction radii are inputted via a text file. However, the ability to parse mathematical expressions from a text file can be extended to input the analytical expression to calculate other defect properties; including the expressions to calculate the change in the migration barriers of mobile defects due to long-range interaction with extended defects ",0.0,https://gitlab.osti.gov/giridharnandipati/ksome,Production,"[DOE CODE,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)]"

This tool is a modular Python package the leverages the United States Geological Survey?s (USGS) 1/3 arc-second Digital Elevation Model (DEM), an open and free public dataset. Roadway gradient (slope) has a strong influence on vehicle energy consumption behavior and longitudinal dynamics. Therefore, any tools, models, or analyses that consider vehicle energy consumption or driving profiles is incomplete without accurate elevation and grade information. Despite the acute need for this data, it is rarely collected alongside GPS (latitude and longitude) data, and tools to post-process GPS data to append elevation and grade are difficult to come by. GradeIT satisfies this significant need in the research community. Utilization of the USGS DEM makes the underlying data available to any potential user and ensures continuous data anywhere in the continental United States. The USGS DEM is a great resource; however, in order to be useful for automotive and traffic engineering applications, significant interpolation and filtering is required to achieve an accurate representation of gradient on the roadway. GradeIT employs a two-dimensional interpolation to approximate elevation at a point on the road from the nearest nodes in the DEM. Then, GradeIT applies multiple filtering techniques to smooth the elevation profile to a realistic road topology. Finally, road grade is derived from the elevation profile and returned as the primary output.",0.0,https://github.com/NREL/gradeit,Production,"[DOE CODE,National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]"

By combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities between the communities. The amount of compression is converted to a distance by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total compressed size of the individual datasets.

Hyper-UBS is more effective at removing a wider variety of cosmic ray spikes from hyperspectral data without introducing undesired spectral bias.  In addition to the core algorithm the Sandia hyper-UBS software package includes additional source code useful in evaluating the effectiveness of the hyper-UBS algorithm. The accompanying source code includes code to generate simulated hyperspectral data contaminated by cosmic ray spikes, several existing despiking algorithms, and code to evaluate the performance of the despiking algorithms on simulated data.",0.0,https://www.sandia.gov/research/research_foundations/bioscience/Sandia_HyperUBS1.html,Production,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

For instance, a simulation on a three-dimensional spatial grid with 512 points per dimension that tracks 64 variables per grid point for 128 time steps yields 8 TB of data. By viewing the data as a dense five-way tensor, we can compute a Tucker decomposition to find inherent low-dimensional multilinear structure, achieving compression ratios of up to 10000 on real-world data sets with negligible loss in accuracy. So that we can operate on such massive data, we present the first-ever distributed-memory parallel implementation for the Tucker decomposition, whose key computations correspond to parallel linear algebra operations, albeit with nonstandard data layouts.

Implementing ROM methods in production codes is typically intrusive, i.e. the native codes must be adapted and modified, with individual ROM methods reimplemented in every application code. This clearly constitutes an obstacle to users who want to use ROMs.To address this, we have developed Pressio, which is a C++ header-only ROM library that can be used by an application code in a non-intrusive fashion. The main objectives behind the design of Pressio are: (a) support for general computational models (data structures, PDE types); (b) heterogeneous hardware (CPU, GPU); (c) performance; and (d) extensibility.Using metaprogramming techniques, Pressio detects and leverages the application?s native linear algebra data structures (e.g. vector and matrix) to run the ROM methods. The application only needs to expose the velocity vector and Jacobian matrix via an adapter class. Pressio checks at compile time that the target application meets the correct API. The library is structured in several modular packages including (a) non-linear least-square solvers (e.g. Gauss-Newton with and without line-search); (b) singular value decomposition (for the computation of the ROM generalized coordinates) and (c) algebraic hyper-reduction.SAND2019-5878 M",0.0,https://ip.sandia.gov/contact.do,Production,"[DOE CODE,Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)]"

Because of the elimination of the compliance measurement, the normalization method significantly simplifies testing requirements to obtain J-R curve.
